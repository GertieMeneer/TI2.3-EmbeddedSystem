# Major Project "Embedded System"
Created by me, and 5 other students

## Project Description
- This period, we started learning C. For this major project, we were given an Esp32 LyraT board. We had to build a smart speaker.
- There were some basic functionalities we had to implement first: an internet radio, a talking clock via NTP, a LCD with a menu and sound analysis via the build in microphones.
- We added our own functionalities as well: a LED-strip changing based on music being played, Philips Hue integration, different talking clock languages, Bluetooth functionality, clapping would select a predefined setting and the speaker was not only controllable via the LCD menu, but also via en API.
